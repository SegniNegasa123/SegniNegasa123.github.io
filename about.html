I completed my secondary education at the Oromia Development Association Special Boarding School, where I spent four years actively involved in science and technology clubs, mentorship, and project development.

Through hands-on experience—building apps, leading peer learning, and completing certified courses—I have developed both technical and leadership skills. I am committed to using technology to solve real-world challenges, particularly in under-resourced communities.

My vision is to contribute to inclusive digital solutions that promote efficiency, transparency, and accessibility—starting with systems that serve my own region. I aim to grow as an ethical, community-driven engineer through institutions that value innovation, research, and impact.</p>
